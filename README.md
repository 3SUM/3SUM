**Hi there** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS student based in Las Vegas, NV. A lot of my open source work is focused on data structures, algorithms and machine learning.

If you need help with my open source work, or you need help with private code, you can [contact me](mailto:mayafluis@gmail.com) to discuss paid work.

## What I'm up to

Currently I'm focusing on advanced data structures such as kd-trees and machine learning.
